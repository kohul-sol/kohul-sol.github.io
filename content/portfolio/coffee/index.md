## About
*Coffee Addict* is a short film created for our second year Video classes. It was directed by *Gabija Barbora Ardzijauskaite* and was created with the help of a full group of people (we called ourselves Cepak) as listed in the credits. My task was assisting them with various miscellaneous tasks: scouting out locations, prop mastery, registering camera information, etc. After we wrapped up filming, the final edit was left to me for my Motion Design class. You can watch it below:
