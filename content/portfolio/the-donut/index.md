## Synopsis
3D donuts made in Blender are actually evil.

## About
Donut is a very short film made to showcase motion tracking skills learned during my third year of university. The film takes the ever prevalent Blender donut and creates a small horror-like experience with it. 

It was created using [a script](https://github.com/adroitwhiz/after-effects-to-blender-export) that allows you to export motion tracking data generated in After Effects to Blender, allowing me to add in my 3D models to a plane generated by AE that perfectly overlays them with the 2D footage recorded for the film.
