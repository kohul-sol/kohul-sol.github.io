## Synopsis
Help the farmer bunnies defend their crops from nefarious robot bugs in this cozy tower defense game for mobile platforms.


## About
*Farmy* is a mobile game developed during my time at XAMK in Kouvola, Finland during the semester I was present. I was a part of a small team and helped with elements of the game's design, along with coding some of the game's elements and creating sound effects and sound libraries for the final game. I developed the damage system, currency drops, the win/lose conditions, menus and sound design, and the team created the systems like the grid placement and towers.
 
The game is a simple tower defense where farmer bunnies try to defend their carrots from being eaten by evil mecha bugs. The core of the game is based around a day night cycle where the towers can see perfectly during the day, but not during the night as they require a light source to see during the night. These light sources come from fireplaces that temporarily light up a small portion of the map, allowing the tower to see and attack enemies moving past it, but they are temporary and require maintainance along with making the player actively manage their resources. The player loses if their carrots are eaten completely.
 
Showcased below is footage from the final game along with some footage of early development builds.
